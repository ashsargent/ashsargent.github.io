I am a solutions motivated problem solver and i love a challenge this is is evident through not only my work here but my hobbies outside my studies.</p>

           <h2>My Downtime</h2>
           <p>I love the outdoors running geocaching and parkour although most of all i love creating. i use a range of methods from eva foam to wood to metal although around 5 years ago i discovered 3d printing and a year ago discovered arduino. this has allowed me to further harness my love for coding and use it in my hobby as well. ive included a picture of my suits below.</p>
